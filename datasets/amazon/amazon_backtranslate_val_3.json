For example, if a character is trying to charm a PC, what skill does the NPC use to defend it? That is way more needed for me, and instead I'll have to print that out and have it with me or tape it to the screen.For just that reason I really felt it wasn't worth the money, as hard as that seems.

Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes, if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something, they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways, the game is more accessible than Scrabble.

The playing pieces are sturdy wooden blocks so the game will stand up to a lot and it is very easy to learn and to teach.","text":["i","am","a","certified","scrabble","club","director","and","i","think","that","this","game","does","what","scrabble","is","so","good","at","doing","without","the","need","to","know","words",".","at","it","'s","core","scrabble","is","a","game","of","logic","and","pattern","recognition","and","those","are","the","two","crucial","elements","of","qwirkle",".","in","this","game","you","maximize","your","points","by","scoring","a","row","of","6","same","shapes","of","different","colors","or","6","different","shapes","of","the","same","color",".","i","play","this","game","with","my","nephews","who","love","it",".","the","playing","pieces","are","sturdy","wooden","blocks","so","the","game","will","stand","up","to","a","lot","and","it","is","very","easy","to","learn","and","to","teach","."]},{"id":22437.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"I am a certified scrabble club director and i think that this game does what scrabble is so good at doing without the need to know words. at its core scrabble is a game of logic and pattern recognition and those are the two crucial elements of qwirkle.","text":["I","am","a","certified","scrabble","club","director","and","i","think","that","this","game","does","what","scrabble","is","so","good","at","doing","without","the","need","to","know","words.","at","its","core","scrabble","is","a","game","of","logic","and","pattern","recognition","and","those","are","the","two","crucial","elements","of","qwirkle."]},{"id":22438.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"We purchased this for my in-laws for Christmas this year and played with my father-in-law, step-mother-in-law, brother-in-law (11), and sister-in-law (13).

That's freakin' weak I say... if this thing breaks it should be due to a transmission failure or motor overload, not a breaking solder on the circuit board.  Anyway, splice it to another wire and it works again, so we'll give it another goSimple fabrications errors are all that need to be corrected with this thing, and you'd see next none 1 or 2 star ratings.","text":["the","toy",",","when","working","it","a","hoot",".","however",",","it","was","doa","out","of","the","box",".","the","problem","was","the","battery","compartment","in","the","remote","..."," ","the","battery","lugs","need","to","be","pried","out","so","they","make","contact","with","the","batteries","."," ","did","that",",","and","it","worked","fine",".","went","about","5","flights",",","plenty","of","awesome","wipeouts",",","then","the","rear","motor","cable","came","diconnected","from","the","board","..."," ","the","solder","broke","."," ","that","'s","freakin","'","weak","i","say","...","if","this","thing","breaks","it","should","be","due","to","a","transmission","failure","or","motor","overload",",","not","a","breaking","solder","on","the","circuit","board","."," ","anyway",",","splice","it","to","another","wire","and","it","works","again",",","so","we","'ll","give","it","another","gosimple","fabrications","errors","are","all","that","need","to","be","corrected","with","this","thing",",","and","you","'d","see","next","none","1","or","2","star","ratings","."]},{"id":22531.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"The room was a bit small, but it was clean and comfortable.","text":["The","room","was","a","bit","small,","but","it","was","clean","and","comfortable."]},{"id":22532.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"I have to tell you, my 11 year old bought this with a gift card he received.

But I'm getting better. Thankfully this thing is very resilient  and can take some punishment, I think because it's so light. I have several indoor only Syma IR heli's and even though they are physically smaller, they are quite a bit heavier. The only minor complaint that I have is that the battery life is quite short. Thankfully it comes with 2 batteries. I do plan on purchasing a 5 pack of extended (220mAh) batteries for it when the weather warms up... don't want to be crashing this thing into a snowbank.","text":["this","thing","is","so","much","fun","to","fly",".","it","is","very","quick","and","responsive",".","definitely","not","a","good","candidate","for","indoor","flying",",","unless","you","have","a","huge","room","to","fly","it","in","(","ie",":","indoor","gym",")",".","the","control","is","very","precise","and","the","heli","has","very","snappy","performance","....","this","is","both","good","and","bad","...","if","you","have","quick","reflexes","it","'s","great",",","but","is","you","do","n't",",","you","'ll","probably","crash","a","lot",",","like","me",".","but","i","'m","getting","better",".","thankfully","this","thing","is","very","resilient"," ","and","can","take","some","punishment",",","i","think","because","it","'s","so","light",".","i","have","several","indoor","only","syma","ir","heli","'s","and","even","though","they","are","physically","smaller",",","they","are","quite","a","bit","heavier",".","the","only","minor","complaint","that","i","have","is","that","the","battery","life","is","quite","short",".","thankfully","it","comes","with","2","batteries",".","i","do","plan","on","purchasing","a","5","pack","of","extended","(","220mah",")","batteries","for","it","when","the","weather","warms","up","...","do","n't","want","to","be","crashing","this","thing","into","a","snowbank","."]},{"id":22545.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"the heli has a very precise control and a very lean performance.","text":["the","heli","has","a","very","precise","control","and","a","very","lean","performance."]},{"id":22546.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"My fav look out of the V911's.

The butterflies are extremely delicate, so to ensure your children don&#8217;t cause any damage to them or their wings, parental supervision is advised.  2.

Those stars help you unlock more levels.At the time, no one ever saw anything like this before. Although the graphics look fairly primitive now, they were still eye candy for most Mario fans, especially back then.Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like: With a free camera, flawless control, and extremely playable environments.Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge.

You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater.

I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game, namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff, ie. master materia, just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.

The fighting system is deep and complex, but doesn't have the huge learning curve that Tekken does. I have heard people call battles played by expert players to be like a dance, with blocking, parrying, dodging, and a variety of attacks used to keep your opponent guessing. A good selection of characters are available, though some are just mirrors of other characters with a few different moves. There is also a practice mode that helps you to learn button combinations for the 50 moves for each character(pretty standard nowadays, but Soul Calibur was one of the first to do this to my knowledge).

Besides this it's a fun game, lots of puzzles to figure out and lots of shoot first ask questions later type of fun.","text":["let","me","give","it","to","you","really","short","and","sweet","!","did","you","like","resident","evil","?","then","you","will","like","dino","crisis",";","it","'s","resident","evil","with","dinosaurs",".","all","capcom","did","was","change","the","characters","and","instead","of","shooting","zombies","you","get","to","shoot","and","kill","raptors","and","other","dinosaurs","that","are","trying","to","eat","you",".","i","myself","am","a","fan","of","resident","evil","so","for","the","price","this","is","a","cool","game",".","the","same","problems","from","re","come","with","dino","crisis","however","....","lack","of","ammo","!","!","besides","this","it","'s","a","fun","game",",","lots","of","puzzles","to","figure","out","and","lots","of","shoot","first","ask","questions","later","type","of","fun","."]},{"id":23586.0,"label":23.0,"raw":"very good game, very good graphics, very good game, very good game, very good price-performance ratio, very good game, very good game.","text":["very","good","game,","very","good","graphics,","very","good","game,","very","good","game,","very","good","price-performance","ratio,","very","good","game,","very","good","game."]},{"id":23587.0,"label":23.0,"raw":"The graphics are well done.

The story is ho-hum, but once you get into it, the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with.  That's the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two.  Also, the graphics and sound are good.  My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking, their mouths speak Japanese, but they speak in English.  (That is if you have the language set on English.)  I'm not sure of this, but I AM sure that their oral movements definately aren't matching what they say.

You get to play as Arthur, Merlin, Lancelot, and the rest of gang through a story derived from Sir Thomas Malory's version of the Arthurian legend.All in all, this game is worth every penny you spend on it.","text":["the","title","says","it","all",".","this","game","has","a","feel","of","magical","and","fantastical","proportions",".","from","the","graphics",",","to","the","music",",","to","the","units",".","everything","lends","to","an","atmosphere","unrivaled","in","any","other","game",".","the","strategic","aspects","of","the","game","are","not","great",",","but","the","tactical","combat","is","excellent",".","battles","can","be","hard","until","you","learn","a","few","tricks",",","such","as","using","parrying","warriors","as","decoys",",","or","flying","missile","units",".","the","best","part","about","the","special","edition(the","only","one","you","can","get",")",",","though",",","are","the","epic","quests",".","they","are","truly","epic",",","with","two","that","are","really","really","epic",".","my","favorite","is","the","good","old","fashioned","arthur","quest",".","you","get","to","play","as","arthur",",","merlin",",","lancelot",",","and","the","rest","of","gang","through","a","story","derived","from","sir","thomas","malory","'s","version","of","the","arthurian","legend",".","all","in","all",",","this","game","is","worth","every","penny","you","spend","on","it","."]},{"id":23850.0,"label":23.0,"raw":"This game has a lot of magic and fantastic aspects, from graphics, music, sounds to atmosphere, the strategic aspects of the game are not great, but the tactical knock is excellent, the knocks can be difficult, until you learn some tricks, like the use of rogues as exchange, or flying-like ones.","text":["This","game","has","a","lot","of","magic","and","fantastic","aspects,","from","graphics,","music,","sounds","to","atmosphere,","the","strategic","aspects","of","the","game","are","not","great,","but","the","tactical","knock","is","excellent,","the","knocks","can","be","difficult,","until","you","learn","some","tricks,","like","the","use","of","rogues","as","exchange,","or","flying-like","ones."]},{"id":23851.0,"label":23.0,"raw":"If I had a choice between SC 2000 or SC 3000 I'd have to say I'd choose 2000 though its graphics are not as good it's a lot more fun and easier to start.

Also if you are thinking about getting SH2 definately play this game cause it helps you understand the town.","text":["i","played","this","game","right","after","i","finished","metal","gear","solid","and","while","i","was","a","little","let","down","from","the","switch","i","found","the","game","entertaining","."," ","i","played","it","at","like","3","in","the","morning","with","the","lights","out","and","it","can","kinda","freak","you","out","."," ","it","is","an","old","game","now","but","if","you","liked","the","resident","evil","series","and","never","got","to","try","this","one","pick","it","up","for","your","ps1","or","ps2","."," ","also","if","you","are","thinking","about","getting","sh2","definately","play","this","game","cause","it","helps","you","understand","the","town","."]},{"id":23991.0,"label":23.0,"raw":"I played this game after I finished metal gear solid, and although I was untapped a bit by the switch, I found it entertaining.","text":["I","played","this","game","after","I","finished","metal","gear","solid,","and","although","I","was","untapped","a","bit","by","the","switch,","I","found","it","entertaining."]},{"id":23992.0,"label":23.0,"raw":"i am finally playing this game.

The game starts off with a C.G.I. cut scene of a you crashing your car in silent hill where you have to find your wife and daughter, If you don't like this genre you wont silent hill, If you didn't like resident evil because it was too hard in the puzzle department silent hill is about as hard. The game play is phenomenal. The game is so dark so that when enemies grab you you get so scared oh my god its scary. The music is amazing but for some reason the character model in the cut scene and the character model of your character in game play is alot different.

Not that this style is bad, but within Silent Hill the gameplay just didn't feel quite as great as it did with Resident Evil, and at times I got a little bored with the wandering around the level that must be done from time to time.
