This video is worth every penny, especially since video of  Janis Joplin seems so scarce... all that I have found is Monterey Pop VHS,  Janis VHS, and the Woodstock DVD.

Ricciarelli is even more effective as Amelia; as a singing actress of the highest order, her interpretation is both strong voiced and well acted. Louis Quilico as Renato is in good voice and Judith Blegen is a dashing Oscar. Bianca Berini is a bit of a low point as Ulrica, not eclipsing Florence Quivar in the subsequent MET recording.

My impression was that, while certainly it is clear there is tension between Paul and Art, both put their heart and soul into this performance.  The versions of Sounds of Silence, Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme, American Tune, America, and other songs are fabulous.  The back up band is outstanding.  Most remarkable of all is how Paul and Art, even though they rework the rhythm of many of the songs, sing in absolute synch without even looking at each other, as if they are two halves of the same soul.  Both men are in fine voice, the audience is totally enthralled, and Paul and Art even appear to warm up to each other towards the end.

Certainly not the '75, '77, Knebworth, or early footage you get with the Led Zeppelin dvd. Don't be fooled by people who join the decades long critical bashing bandwagon. Some things get branded because it is easy to go along with the popular, yet incorrect, perception.","text":["this","is","footage","of","led","zeppelin","at","their","peak","period",".","the","'","73","tour",",","apart","from","the","fact","plant","'s","voice","had","already","changed",",","is","the","best","tour","zeppelin","ever","had",".","this","film","captures","it",".","the","sound","is","much","more","powerful","than","any","other","live","releases",",","and","the","playing","is","perfectly","typical","of","zep","in","'","73",".","it","does","n't","get","any","better",".","certainly","not","the","'","75",",","'","77",",","knebworth",",","or","early","footage","you","get","with","the","led","zeppelin","dvd",".","do","n't","be","fooled","by","people","who","join","the","decades","long","critical","bashing","bandwagon",".","some","things","get","branded","because","it","is","easy","to","go","along","with","the","popular",",","yet","incorrect",",","perception","."]},{"id":6766.0,"label":6.0,"raw":"the '73 tour, apart from the fact that plants had already gangled, is the best tour zeppelin ever had.","text":["the","'73","tour,","apart","from","the","fact","that","plants","had","already","gangled,","is","the","best","tour","zeppelin","ever","had."]},{"id":6767.0,"label":6.0,"raw":"This is still one of the best concert films ever made, one that holds up to repeated viewing not only for the quality of the performance but the narrative of the film.

There is no Denzel Washington nor Wesley Snipes to portray characters. No Quincy Jones or Spike Lee to explain the idiom. One can see and hear the voices of the actual musicians themselves in the process of living and creating music.

It translates to video quite nicely, something which wasn't transmitted for the Momentary Lapse tour.I'd say this is a nice one to get if you're a Floyd or Waters fan, but keep an open mind.","text":["first","of","all",",","the","sound","for","the","concert","is","clearly","cleaned","up",",","as","i","heard","this","show","when","it","hit","the","radio","the","first","time","."," ","there","were","points","in","the","radio","show","that","were","clearly","unlistenable",".","i","know","some","floyd","purists","wo","n't","like","all","of","the","guest","stars",",","but","they","are","not","bad","half","the","time","."," ","bryan","adams","works","fairly","effectivly",",","and","paul","carrack","on","hey","you","is","even","better","than","the","original","."," ","on","the","other","hand",",","cyndi","lauper","on","another","brick","2","and","sinead","and","the","band","really","take","away","from","some","otherwise","powerful","songs",".","the","imagery","of","this","show","is","spectacular",",","as","it","must","have","been","for","the","original","tour","(","do","they","have","an","entire","concert","for","that","?",")","."," ","it","translates","to","video","quite","nicely",",","something","which","was","n't","transmitted","for","the","momentary","lapse","tour",".","i'd","say","this","is","a","nice","one","to","get","if","you","'re","a","floyd","or","waters","fan",",","but","keep","an","open","mind","."]},{"id":6914.0,"label":6.0,"raw":"the music is great, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music is good, the music","text":["the","music","is","great,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music","is","good,","the","music"]},{"id":6915.0,"label":6.0,"raw":"This show from 1990 contains the largest, most complex stage setup ever used in a rock show, boggling the mind with all the moving parts and multimedia.

But considering the production values of jazz performances recorded in the early 90's, its likely the record company and the producers were being budget-conscious(i.e., cheap). Too bad. It would have been interesting to know what was going through Scofield's mind back then. He's very insightful, and a pretty funny guy to boot.

Any self-respecting tenor would use this aria to stir the audience into frenzy, as intended by Verdi.  When Domingo hit the big high note, he decided to cut it short and sat down.  And sat down he did.  He still got his usual ovation at the Met.  If it was at Parma, he would have been boo'ed off the stage, Domingo or not. I have to agree with three of the reviewers that this was a sub-par performance by Domingo.  Seven years earlier, in 1982, he did not cheat in his Deutsche Grammophon recording (available on CD). He was Domingo.One key performer can ruin an opera in one key aria!  Millo, Milnes, and Zajick were superb.Domingo has the last laugh, of course.  He lasted half a century by cheating here and there, whereas many of his colleagues lasted only half as long.","text":["\"","celeste","aida","\"","is","the","big","aria","."," ","any","self","-","respecting","tenor","would","use","this","aria","to","stir","the","audience","into","frenzy",",","as","intended","by","verdi","."," ","when","domingo","hit","the","big","high","note",",","he","decided","to","cut","it","short","and","sat","down","."," ","and","sat","down","he","did","."," ","he","still","got","his","usual","ovation","at","the","met","."," ","if","it","was","at","parma",",","he","would","have","been","boo'ed","off","the","stage",",","domingo","or","not",".","i","have","to","agree","with","three","of","the","reviewers","that","this","was","a","sub","-","par","performance","by","domingo","."," ","seven","years","earlier",",","in","1982",",","he","did","not","cheat","in","his","deutsche","grammophon","recording","(","available","on","cd",")",".","he","was","domingo",".","one","key","performer","can","ruin","an","opera","in","one","key","aria","!"," ","millo",",","milnes",",","and","zajick","were","superb",".","domingo","has","the","last","laugh",",","of","course","."," ","he","lasted","half","a","century","by","cheating","here","and","there",",","whereas","many","of","his","colleagues","lasted","only","half","as","long","."]},{"id":6999.0,"label":6.0,"raw":"The aria was used by every confident tenor to stir up the public in excitement, as intended by verdi.","text":["The","aria","was","used","by","every","confident","tenor","to","stir","up","the","public","in","excitement,","as","intended","by","verdi."]},{"id":9000.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.

Irresistable and magical tunes, the kind that truly evoked a unique mood and atmosphere. I played the record to death and have done likewise with my old CD copy. This music just never gets \"old\" or boring. A classic in the truest sense of the word. You don't have to be a jazz fan to enjoy this, just let the music play and let it soak into your consciousness.

So it's slightly uneven, but the best songs make it very worthwhile.","text":["the","closest","thing","to","a","mainstream","album","that","nick","ever","recorded",".","there","'s","even","a","near","-","rocker","(","\"","hazy","janey","ii","\"",")",",","albeit","one","in","nick","'s","usual","somber","style",".","i","actually","do","n't","think","this","is","nearly","as","good","as","the","previous","record","or","the","next","one",":","a","bunch","of","weak","instrumentals","(","title","track",";","\"","sunday","\"",";","\"","fly","\"",")",",","and","\"","poor","boy","\"","is","the","closest","to","overproduced","drake","gets",".","regardless",",","there","are","several","fantastic","songs",":","\"","hazy","janey","ii","\"","and","its","psychedelic","-","folk","counterpart",",","\"","hazy","janey","i","\"",";","\"","at","the","chime","of","a","city","clock","\"",",","which","is","some","good","jazzy","stuff",";","\"","one","of","those","things","first","\"","is","charming","but","slightly","rambling",";","and","\"","northern","sky","\"","is","one","of","the","most","resonant","pieces","in","drake","'s","catalogue",",","which","is","saying","something",".","so","it","'s","slightly","uneven",",","but","the","best","songs","make","it","very","worthwhile","."]},{"id":9242.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"the album is quite funny, but it is quite funny.","text":["the","album","is","quite","funny,","but","it","is","quite","funny."]},{"id":9243.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"This is just a CD you've got to have.

Good album cover too (the original vinyl album had square color post cards inside and a strange and annoying 4 fold opening system!).  Oliver's Army and Watching the detectives were hit singles from the album, but ever song on the album was good enough to be a single -- a rare feat.","text":["...","and","pay","attention","to","elvis","."," ","it","is","packed","full","of","great","pop","\/","new","-","wave","\/","punk","tracks","."," ","this","album","made","it","clear","that","elvis","it","a","great",",","unique","talent",",","and","that","he","could","consistently","write","songs","of","uncommon","quality","."," ","this","album","probably","formed","the","basis","(","or","rocket","booster",")","to","his","subsequent","song","writing","career","."," ","this","genre","is","not","one","that","i","am","normally","drawn","to","--","but","these","are","great","songs","."," ","good","album","cover","too","(","the","original","vinyl","album","had","square","color","post","cards","inside","and","a","strange","and","annoying","4","fold","opening","system","!",")","."," ","oliver","'s","army","and","watching","the","detectives","were","hit","singles","from","the","album",",","but","ever","song","on","the","album","was","good","enough","to","be","a","single","--","a","rare","feat","."]},{"id":9305.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"Elvis was born in New York City, the son of Elvis Presley and his wife, Elvis Presley.","text":["Elvis","was","born","in","New","York","City,","the","son","of","Elvis","Presley","and","his","wife,","Elvis","Presley."]},{"id":9306.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"I think this is an album where either you're into it, or you aren't -- it isn't an issue of whether it's a \"good\" record, or a \"bad\" one.

Simply one of the most gorgeous CDs in her collection. It is wonderful to hear Joni's voice now, it is so different than back in the '70s... but it is definitely the same compelling, masterful instrument. As she has become older and her voice has deepened and grown a bit raspy, it has become downright haunting in places on this CD, like in \"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\" and my favorite \"Two Grey Rooms\".

I think the hooks are less memorable as on Rock Steady and The Beacon Street Collection.  Sixteen is an exception as its a fairly catchy new wave rock tune.

Milt's playing is nice here, just not anything that sets me on edge.Like a lot of Cannonball albums from this period, there is a healthy mix of ballads (\"Serves Me Right\"), bebop (\"Groovin' High\"), interesting originals (\"Blues Oriental\" by Milt Jackson) and extremely funky material (\"Sounds for Sid\").  Not a spectacular achievement but a very good one.  Fans of Cannonball's 50s playing will find a lot to enjoy here.","text":["this","is","a","very","nice","blow","session",",","recorded","almost","9","months","after","the","extremely","popular","somethin'","else","."," ","unlike","the","earlier","album",",","this","one","is","definitely","a","cannonball","album","in","style","."," ","unlike","many","later","albums",",","this","is","a","blowing","session","rather","than","a","studio","appearance","by","a","live",",","working","band",".","i'll","admit","to","being","lukewarm","on","milt","jackson","and","my","judgment","of","this","album","is","probably","affected","downward","as","a","result","."," ","milt","'s","playing","is","nice","here",",","just","not","anything","that","sets","me","on","edge",".","like","a","lot","of","cannonball","albums","from","this","period",",","there","is","a","healthy","mix","of","ballads","(","\"","serves","me","right","\"",")",",","bebop","(","\"","groovin","'","high","\"",")",",","interesting","originals","(","\"","blues","oriental","\"","by","milt","jackson",")","and","extremely","funky","material","(","\"","sounds","for","sid","\"",")","."," ","not","a","spectacular","achievement","but","a","very","good","one","."," ","fans","of","cannonball","'s","50s","playing","will","find","a","lot","to","enjoy","here","."]},{"id":9662.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"This album is a very good blow - session, recorded almost 9 months after the extravagant popular somethin'else.","text":["This","album","is","a","very","good","blow","-","session,","recorded","almost","9","months","after","the","extravagant","popular","somethin'else."]},{"id":9663.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"On a shopping spree, I bought this one, speak no evil and maiden voyage.

That said, the album itself was totally groundbreaking for 1968, especially with all of the early electronic effects (ring modulators particularly) used in the music. It's also worth noting that there is no guitar on the album- instead, the band opts for lots of really solid violin and awesome keyboards. The songs themselves are all very well written, especially those on side 2. My personal favorites are probably \"Where is Yesterday\", \"Love Song for the Dead Che\", and \"Stranded in Time\". The album isn't all too accessible initially, but with enough listening all of the tracks will eventually grow on you. And the vinyl pressing itself rules. Very quiet pressing, and comes in the original manila envelope. Would highly recommend to Jefferson Airplane fans, but anybody could enjoy this album.

R&B,rap and hip-hop fans fell in love with her talented singing vocals. The most memorable track from this album is UN-BREAK MY HEART,which is of course,smooth R&B. I just love the sound of Edmonds' guitar on that song. When I first heard the song in 1996 when this album was released,I thought it was Gloria Estefan who recorded it since her voice sounds much like Braxton's. That same year,Edmonds produced Eric Clapton's hit CHANGE THE WORLD from the movie PHENOMENON starring John Travolta. The other songs are great.

While dance tracks Come On Over Here and You're Makin Me High, inject an grittier sound in her voice. This is the one album I enjoyed the most that Toni Braxton released.

And like Mayfield's \"People Get Ready\" he did it with a spiritual solution: \"God Is Love\", \"Wholy Holy\".It was America's time to stop and finally ask the question, \"what is going on?\" And now with another war raging in the Middle East, the question is still relevant today. Marvin's spiritual answers remain the only hope for this world in the 21st century. A thought provoking recording, smoothly edited with an operatic flow of listening, resulting in Marvin Gaye's masterpiece and most redeeming effort.","text":["with","the","release","of","\"","what","'s","going","on","\"","in","1971",",","marvin","gaye","ignited","the","social","consciousness","movement","in","music",".","with","a","senseless","war","in","vietnam",",","and","racism","still","prominent","in","america",".","pollution","of","our","water","and","the","air","we","breath",".","and","black","unemployment","levels","continuously","rising",",","marvin","hit","a","spot","that","had","been","sorely","lacking","in","music",",","with","the","exception","of","maybe","curtis","mayfield",".","and","like","mayfield","'s","\"","people","get","ready","\"","he","did","it","with","a","spiritual","solution",":","\"","god","is","love","\"",",","\"","wholy","holy\".it","was","america","'s","time","to","stop","and","finally","ask","the","question",",","\"","what","is","going","on","?","\"","and","now","with","another","war","raging","in","the","middle","east",",","the","question","is","still","relevant","today",".","marvin","'s","spiritual","answers","remain","the","only","hope","for","this","world","in","the","21st","century",".","a","thought","provoking","recording",",","smoothly","edited","with","an","operatic","flow","of","listening",",","resulting","in","marvin","gaye","'s","masterpiece","and","most","redeeming","effort","."]},{"id":9872.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"With the release of \" what's going on \" in 1971 marvin gaye ignited the movement of social awareness in music with a senseless war in vietnam, and still prominent racism in america.","text":["With","the","release","of","\"","what's","going","on","\"","in","1971","marvin","gaye","ignited","the","movement","of","social","awareness","in","music","with","a","senseless","war","in","vietnam,","and","still","prominent","racism","in","america."]},{"id":9873.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"The title says it all.

I don't consider myself an audiophile, rarely commenting on sound quality unless it's vastly improved or way below par, but to my ears the bottom end of this recording is completely stripped away. Even turning up the bass on fairly expensive speakers produces little to no low end on this recording (or simply a distorted low end). All of which is a shame, because the bass drives many of the tracks on this album. I have gone back to an older edition of this album just to enjoy it, but seeing that newer remasters are floating around out there (two since this edition), I may have to pick up one of the more recent releases and hope for the best.","text":["the","three","stars","i","gave","this","album","have","nothing","to","do","with","the","music","or","lyrics","of","marvin","gaye",".","what","'s","going","on","is","an","all","time","classic","and","brings","great","joy","and","insight","whenever","listened","to",".","i","have","had","several","versions","of","this","album","since","the","early","nineties","...","but","this","has","to","be","the","worst","remaster","i","have","ever","heard",".","i","do","n't","consider","myself","an","audiophile",",","rarely","commenting","on","sound","quality","unless","it","'s","vastly","improved","or","way","below","par",",","but","to","my","ears","the","bottom","end","of","this","recording","is","completely","stripped","away",".","even","turning","up","the","bass","on","fairly","expensive","speakers","produces","little","to","no","low","end","on","this","recording","(","or","simply","a","distorted","low","end",")",".","all","of","which","is","a","shame",",","because","the","bass","drives","many","of","the","tracks","on","this","album",".","i","have","gone","back","to","an","older","edition","of","this","album","just","to","enjoy","it",",","but","seeing","that","newer","remasters","are","floating","around","out","there","(","two","since","this","edition",")",",","i","may","have","to","pick","up","one","of","the","more","recent","releases","and","hope","for","the","best","."]},{"id":9875.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"very good album, very good sound, very good album, very good album, very good album, very good album, very good album.","text":["very","good","album,","very","good","sound,","very","good","album,","very","good","album,","very","good","album,","very","good","album,","very","good","album."]},{"id":9876.0,"label":9.0,"raw":"....and in listening to the words of the title cut--in light of what's occurred on the East Coast, and what's going to occur if war goes on a lil too long--very, very, very prophetic.

I decided to use the bookmarks by telling them what time they had to go to sleep, then they take a look at their clock and program it to beep when it's lights out time.  And it works....beautifully!I would definitely recommend these to people who have kids who love to read...just might need to encourage sleep to get them to school on time.","text":["so","i","see","most","of","the","reviews","talk","about","how","great","these","are","at","encouraging","reading",".","i","have","to","admit",",","i","have","a","somewhat","different","use","-","to","get","my","kids","to","stop","reading","and","go","to","bed","!"," ","i","was","having","such","trouble","getting","them","to","stop","reading","on","school","nights","that","on","many","nights",",","i","was","going","to","sleep","before","them",".","and","they","are","in","elementary","school",",","so","they","needed","more","sleep","than","that","."," ","so","i","thought","they","might","really","like","having","a","little","beep","go","off","when","it","was","time","to","stop","and","go","to","bed","."," ","i","decided","to","use","the","bookmarks","by","telling","them","what","time","they","had","to","go","to","sleep",",","then","they","take","a","look","at","their","clock","and","program","it","to","beep","when","it","'s","lights","out","time","."," ","and","it","works","....","beautifully!i","would","definitely","recommend","these","to","people","who","have","kids","who","love","to","read","...","just","might","need","to","encourage","sleep","to","get","them","to","school","on","time","."]},{"id":22140.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"The staff were very friendly and helpful.","text":["The","staff","were","very","friendly","and","helpful."]},{"id":22141.0,"label":22.0,"raw":"I've been wanting something like this for ages.

This game is not for introverts or for someone seeking a high educational value from a game.

It provides no new variants to game play, no extra aspects to consider, no new rules.  It's just more cards.
